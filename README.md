# Companion Backend Dev Challenge

Congratulations on moving to the 2nd round of interviews! In this round, all candidates will be given a Programming Challenge
in order for us to better assess your skill, code structure, and git flow. Please find instructions for the programming challenge
below, and make sure to read the entire prompt thoroughly. You have exactly 7 days to complete the challenge. If you need more 
time to finish, please send us what you have at the end of 7 days, and then send over your final solution once you have completed 
it. We will assess you on both products. You can use any programming language that you're comfortable with to complete this 
Programming Challenge. As always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck!

## Programming Challenge

Your task is to create a REST API for a note taking app. At a minimum, it should support the following functionality:

- Users must log in via some authentication mechanism
- Users can create, read, edit, and delete their own notes
- Notes can be shared with other users, with various sharing permissions (i.e. a user could grant either read-only access, 
or read-write access)

Things you do not have to worry about include:

- Creating a registration system for users — it’s fine to have a set of hard-coded users
- Securing the API for production (i.e. setting up HTTPS)

### Extended Functionality

After completing the above, pick one of the following tasks to work on:

- Add support for user groups, where sharing permissions can be applied on the group level in addition to the user level
- Create a front-end app that uses your API

These are more intensive tasks, so we don’t expect you to complete either (unless you really want to impress us). Just a 
start that gives us an idea of how you would approach the task is enough.

**IMPORTANT**: Give careful thought to your code organization. You can use the language of your choice to complete the
question, but the code must be functional and given to us in a state where we can easily run and interpret it (documentation 
helps!). Also, remember that scalability is an important consideration for any backend service, so make sure your code is 
written with that in mind.
